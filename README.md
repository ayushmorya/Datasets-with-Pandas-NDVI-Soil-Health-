# Datasets-with-Pandas-NDVI-Soil-Health-
This repository documents what I learned today about importing, inspecting, and cleaning real-world datasets using Python (Pandas) in Jupyter Notebook. The work is based on an NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) soil health dataset and follows an industry-style data preprocessing workflow.
